# Lets-Chat
LetsChat is a base that can be built upon to create a social media platform.

If you find a bug make a Pull request that fixes the bug or file an Issue.

Current goals: 
1. Add more basic features out of the box so that implementing those features in forks doesn't take extra time.
2. Release version 6.0 which would feature full Realtime Filters integration.

## Instructions to Implement:

1. Change the backend server with your backend server.
2. This is made as customisable and easy to tweak as possible, so tweak all you want.

<a href="https://bhargavekbote.github.io/NeoChat/">NeoChat</a> is developed by me and is a great example/proof-of-concept of how to build a social media website using LetsChat, you can use it as a reference for your project if you are looking for one but I suggest you to use your creativity.

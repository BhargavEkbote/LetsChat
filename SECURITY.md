# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest version is the only currently supported version, the version number does not matter that much as there have already been 2 major changes after version 5.1 yet it is still the latest one. To be exact we are on 5.1.4 but all previous ones that belong in the 5.1.x list are still supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :x:                |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability then report it in the issue tracker, don't expect a quick response or a reason for why it has been declined.
